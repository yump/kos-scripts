DEPRECATED since functions and local variables were added.

Standard subroutine conventions:

1. Subroutines shall return their results, if any, in the variable RESULT.

2. All variables assigned in a subroutine, except for RESULT, shall be prefixed
   with the name of the subroutine or a short string derived from same.

3. Subroutines shall explcitly document all side effects at the beginning of 
   the file.  Changing configuration variables, steering the ship, firing
   engines, creating maneuver nodes, etc.

4. Subroutines must not block.
